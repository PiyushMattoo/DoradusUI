What is Spider?
Spider is one of the storage services offered by Doradus. Spider is flexible and easy-to-use, so it’s great for learning about the Doradus data model and query language. In this tutorial, we’ll create a simple Spider application, add some data, change the schema, and perform some queries. Along the way, we’ll introduce the Doradus REST API.
Creating a Spider Application
To store data in Doradus, we first need a database instance, which Doradus calls an application. Each application has a schema, which defines the application’s name and the storage service that will manage its data. Spider is the default storage service, so we don’t have to explicitly choose it. Furthermore, Spider allows dynamically-added tables and fields, so the only thing our schema needs is the application name. The simplest Spider application schema is the following XML document:
<application name="HelloSpider"/>
Doradus also supports JSON for all input and output messages. The equivalent JSON document is:
{"HelloSpider": null}
We’ll mostly use JSON in this tutorial: see the Doradus Spider documentation for more details on JSON and XML message formats.
To create the application, we need to POST the schema to the system resource called _applications. If we have the Doradus server running on our local machine and we have curl, we can use the following command:
curl -X POST -d '{"HelloSpider": null}' -H "content-type: application/json" http://localhost:1123/_applications
This creates an application named HelloSpider, managed by the Spider storage service. We can verify that the application exists by getting its schema with this command:
curl http://localhost:1123/_applications/HelloSpider
(BTW, since this is a GET command, it works in a browser as well.) By default, output messages are returned in XML, so we’ll get the following schema:
<application name="HelloSpider">
   <options>
      <option name="AutoTables">true</option>
      <option name="StorageService">SpiderService</option>
   </options>
</application>
We can request JSON formatting either by adding the header accept: application/json to the request or by adding ?format=json to the URI:
curl http://localhost:1123/_applications/HelloSpider?format=json
The response in JSON is shown below:
{"HelloSpider": {
   "options": {
      "AutoTables": "true",
      "StorageService": "SpiderService"
   }
}}
Notice that our application’s schema is automatically assigned default options: The StorageService option defaults to SpiderService, and the AutoTables option defaults to true. This option is described next.
Adding Some Data
Doradus stores an application’s data in tables, whose members are called objects. An object’s values are stored in fields. When a Spider application’s AutoTables option is true, tables can be dynamically added. And, since Spider supports dynamically-added fields, we can objects and assign any fields we want to.
Let’s create some “spider name” objects by creating a JSON-formatted file called spiders.data:
{"batch": {
   "docs": [
      {"doc": {"Name": "Tarantula"}},
      {"doc": {"Name": "Alpha Romeo"}},
      {"doc": {"Name": "Itsy Bitsy"}}
   ]
}}
The outer batch group contains an array called docs, which contains one doc group per object. In this example, each object assigns a single field called Name. We can add these objects to a table called Spiders using the REST URI: POST /application/table. Using curl:
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" -d @spiders.data http://localhost:1123/HelloSpider/Spiders
When we send an update to the Spiders table, if it doesn’t exist, the Spider service creates it automatically. The objects are then added, setting the Name field for each one. Since objects must have an ID and we didn’t specify any, Doradus assigns each object a unique ID. In case we need to know what these are right away, the IDs are returned in the REST response of our POST command:
{"batch-result": {
   "status": "OK",
   "has_updates": "true",
   "docs": [
      {"doc": {"updated": "true", "status": "OK", "_ID": "AAFNRJ9GsmZtp5adLQAA"}},
      {"doc": {"updated": "true", "status": "OK", "_ID": "AAFNRJ9GwmZtp5adLQAA"}},
      {"doc": {"updated": "true", "status": "OK", "_ID": "AAFNRJ9Gw2Ztp5adLQAA"}}
   ]
}}
The batch-result group contains a docs array with one doc group for each object. These doc groups appear in the same order as the input batch so we can correlate them. Each object’s ID is given in the _ID field along with the status for that update. The updated and status fields show that an update actually occurred. These fields might seem superfluous, but some updates might not actually change anything, which we’ll discuss later.
What happens if we fetch the application schema now? In JSON, it looks like this:
{"HelloSpider": {
   "options": {
      "AutoTables": "true",
      "StorageService": "SpiderService"
   },
   "tables": {
      "Spiders": {}
   }
}}
This shows that our schema was automatically extended to declare the Spiders table without any explicitly-defined fields. This means the Name field we assigned is anonymous. Such fields are implicitly considered text and indexed using the full text analyzer. This means it is efficient to query such fields even though they are undefined.
Querying Objects
Doradus supports two kinds of queries: object queries, which select and return objects, and aggregate queries, which select objects and perform metric computations such as COUNT. Object queries use the general URI format:
GET /application/table/_query?{params}
Where application and table specify which objects we want, _query is the system resource for object queries, and {params} are the query parameters. The only required parameter is ‘q’, which is the Doradus Query Language (DQL) expression. The simplest object query is to return all objects using the query parameter q=*:
curl -H "accept: application/json" http://localhost:1123/HelloSpider/Spiders/_query?q=*
(Notice that we requested JSON by adding an accept header, but we could append &format=json to the URI instead.) This returns a JSON message like this:
{"results": {
   "docs": [
      {"doc": {"Name": "Tarantula", "_ID":"AAFNRJ9GsmZtp5adLQAA"}},
      {"doc": {"Name": "Itsy Bitsy", "_ID":"AAFNRJ9Gw2Ztp5adLQAA"}},
      {"doc": {"Name": "Alpha Romeo", "_ID": "AAFNRJ9GwmZtp5adLQAA"}}
   ]
}}
What we actually get is a page of results. If there were more than 100 objects, the response would get a continue token, which we can use to fetch the next page. We can control the page size with the ‘s’ parameter:
curl -H "accept: application/json" http://localhost:1123/HelloSpider/Spiders/_query?q=*&s=50
Here’s a query that finds all Spiders whose name contains the term “alpha”:
curl -H "accept: application/json" http://localhost:1123/HelloSpider/Spiders/_query?q=Name:alpha
Note that the term alpha will select the object whose name is Alpha Romeo because text searches are case-insensitive. If we want an exact match instead of searching for a field containing a term, we would ‘=’ instead of a ‘:’ as the comparison operator: Name='alpha romeo' (also case-insensitive). DQL supports a wide range of query expressions, and object queries support several other parameters. See the full Doradus Spider documentation for details.
Now let’s try an aggregate query, which uses the system resource _aggregate. The simplest aggregate query counts all objects using the ‘m’ parameter:
curl -H "accept: application/json" http://localhost:1123/HelloSpider/Spiders/_aggregate?m=COUNT(*)
Here’s a typical response for this query:
{"results": {
   "aggregate": {"metric": "COUNT(*)"},
   "totalobjects": "3",
   "value": "3"
}}
The metric function result is given in the field called value. The aggregate field echoes the query we requested, and the totalobjects field indicates how many objects were scanned by this query. (For some queries, value and totalobjects can be different.) Like object queries, aggregate queries support several parameters and a wide range of functions, so see the full documentation for details.
Explicitly Defining Fields
When might we want to explicitly define fields in a Spider schema? There are three things we can change when we explicitly define a field: (1) the field’s type, (2) how it is indexed, and (3) the field’s cardinality. By default, an undefined field’s type is considered text, it is indexed with a full text analyzer, and it is considered single-valued. Let’s show some examples by modifying the schema of our HelloSpider application.
With this change, we also demonstrate that schema updates use replacement semantics. This means the old schema is completely replaced by the new one. So, if we omit a previously-defined table, it is deleted, along with its data. Any new tables are added, and new fields in an existing table are added. Here’s the schema that will replace our previous HelloSpider schema:
{"HelloSpider": {
    "options": {
        "AutoTables": "true",
        "StorageService":"SpiderService"
    },
    "tables": {
        "Movies": {
            "fields": {
                "Budget": {"type": "integer", "analyzer": "IntegerAnalyzer"},
                "Cancelled": {"type": "boolean", "analyzer":"BooleanAnalyzer"}, 
                "Director": {"type":"text", "analyzer": "TextAnalyzer"},
                "Leads": {"type": "text", "collection": "true", "analyzer": "TextAnalyzer"},
                "Name": {"type": "text", "analyzer": "TextAnalyzer"},
                "ReleaseDate": {"type": "timestamp", "analyzer": "DateAnalyzer"}
            }
        }
    }
}}
This schema drops the Spiders table and adds a new one called Movies. Six fields are declared, showing some of the scalar types supported: integer, boolean, text, and timestamp. For Leads, the collection property is set to true: this makes the field multi-valued, allowing it to hold a set of values per object. Each field’s analyzer is also declared, though in this example the default analyzer is declared for each field. Other analyzers such as the OpaqueTextAnalyzer and NullAnalyzer are available depending on the field type. Though not shown here, Doradus also supports link fields, which create bi-directional relationships between objects. See the full documentation for more details on analyzers and link fields.
If the schema above resides in a file called updated-schema.json, we can apply it with the following PUT command:
curl -X PUT -H "content-type: application/json" -d @updated-schema.json http://localhost:1123/_applications/HelloSpider
Now let’s insert some data about Spider-Man movies. This time, we’ll assign the object IDs. See the full batch data in the sample HelloWorld application included with the doradus-client package. But here’s a sample:
{"batch": {
    "docs": [
        {"doc": {
            "_ID": "Spidy1",
            "Name": "Spider-Man",
            "ReleaseDate": "2002-05-03",
            "Cancelled": false,
            "Director": "Sam Raimi",
            "Leads": ["Tobey Maguire", "Kirsten Dunst", "Willem Dafoe"],
            "Budget": 240000000
        }},
        {"doc": {
            "_ID": "Spidy2",
            "Name": "Spider-Man 2",
            "ReleaseDate": "2004-06-04",
            "Cancelled": false,
            "Director": "Sam Raimi",
            "Leads": ["Tobey Maguire", "Kirsten Dunst", "Alfred Molina"],
            "Budget": 200000000
        }},
        ...
   ]
}}
Now let’s perform an aggregate query that computes the average budget of the six Spider-Man movies based on our loaded data:
curl 'http://localhost:1123/HelloSpider/Movies/_aggregate?m=AVERAGE(Budget)&format=json'
This produces the result:
{"results": {
   "aggregate": {"metric": "AVERAGE(Budget)"},
   "totalobjects": "6",
   "value": "232000000"
}}
In other words, $232 million per movie on average. It’s no wonder that 4 of the 25 most-expensive movies are Spider-Man!
Updating and Deleting Objects
How do we update existing objects? Updates use the same REST commands as adding objects. Within an input batch, a doc group becomes an “insert” if either (1) no _ID value was given or (2) no object with the specified _ID exists. But if an ID is given and the object exists, the existing object is updated. Any field values specified in the update affect existing values as follows:
1.	If the field is a single-valued scalar, its existing value is replaced by the new value.
2.	A field can be nullified by assigning it an empty value in XML or an empty string or the keyword null in JSON.
3.	If one or more values are assigned to a multi-valued scalar or link field, the values are added to the existing values. But since links and MV scalars are sets, duplicates are not stored.
How do we remove a value from a multi-valued scalar or link field? These fields can be assigned a remove group, whose values are removed from the current set. If we want to, we can also add values in the same update. Example:
{"batch": {
    "docs": [
        {"doc": {
            "_ID": "Spidy1",
            "Leads": {"remove": ["Willem Dafoe"], "add": ["Harrison Ford"]},
        }}
    ]
}}
This update removes Willem Dafoe and adds Harrison Ford as a lead in the first Spider-Man movie. (No Harrison Ford, was not really in the movie.) Note that if an update does not actually change anything, that result is reflected in the REST response. Updates are generally idempotent: it’s safe to apply the same update twice—the duplicate update is a no-op. (The only update that is not idempotent is adding an object without specifying an ID.)
Finally, let’s look at deleting objects. This command uses the DELETE verb and the same batch structure as updates, except that only the _ID field is required for each doc group. Example:
DELETE /HelloSpider/Movies
{"batch": {
    "docs": [
        {"doc": {"_ID": "Spidy1"}},
        {"doc": {"_ID": "Spidy6"}}
    ]
}}
This command deletes the movies with IDs Spidy1 and Spidy6. It’s not an error if the objects are already deleted since deletes are also idempotent.
